# Automath-NewMath bridge

This directory defines the NewMath-side bridge layer between
`the-omega-institute/automath` and `the-omega-institute/newmath`.

The bridge is intentionally gated. It records source artifacts, candidate
destinations, review boundaries, and audit obligations. The supervisor may
fetch the latest refs and generate local review packets, but it does not push,
publish, send external messages, or directly write paper / Lean / dossier
content.

## Files

- `bridge_manifest.schema.json` defines the JSONL record contract.
- `bridge_manifest.jsonl` is the durable manifest. Each line is one auditable
  source-to-destination record.
- `bridge_sources.json` is the read-only scan configuration used to generate
  candidate packet records.
- `scan_bridge_sources.py` observes configured paths and writes candidate JSONL.
- `bridge_pipeline_config.json` defines dynamic discovery rules for growing
  Automath and NewMath refs. In this worktree, NewMath is `.` and Automath is
  read from the sibling Automath bridge worktree.
- `run_bridge_pipeline.py` discovers new or changed bridgeable artifacts from
  both repos, synthesizes cross-repo readiness, and renders a local transfer
  plan.
- `bridge_synthesis.py` scans both repos for matching evidence: NewMath
  constant/RealConstant material, BEDC TasteGate/supervisor patterns, Automath
  Killo/golden Lean surfaces, and Automath gate surfaces.
- `bridge_gates.py` runs deterministic local gates over the bridge inbox.
- `bridge_supervisor.py` periodically fetches both repos, runs discovery, runs
  gates, and can write local ignored review packets.
- `bridge_to_bedc_board.py` converts gate-passed Automath-to-NewMath records
  into BEDC-native BOARD candidates by calling `tools/bedc-deep/board_spawn.py`.
- `validate_bridge_manifest.py` validates manifest or packet JSONL records.
- `render_bridge_report.py` renders manifest or packet JSONL as Markdown for
  human and AI review.
- `review_packets/` contains durable bridge review packets for local review
  memory. They are metadata/evidence surfaces only: they must not become BEDC
  BOARD `local_inputs`, paper provenance, or theorem evidence.
- `inbox/`, `out/`, `state/`, and `logs/` are runtime directories. Generated
  contents are ignored by Git and should not be uploaded.

The bridge ledger lives at `docs/bridge/automath-newmath-bridge.md`.

## Artifact kinds

The manifest schema currently admits these bridge artifact kinds:

- `proposal`
- `accepted_proposal`
- `paper_seed_stub`
- `taste_gate_witness`
- `lean_theorem`
- `paper_claim`
- `open_problem_target`
- `scope_ledger`
- `review_packet`
- `writeback_packet`
- `publication_slug`
- `pipeline_status`
- `audit_failure`
- `candidate_mechanism`

## Status meanings

- `observed`: recorded as source material, not yet approved for consumption.
- `candidate`: plausible bridge item awaiting operator decision.
- `accepted`: approved by an operator for the named destination.
- `consumed`: destination has used the artifact and recorded the resulting path.
- `blocked`: cannot move forward without a specific fix.
- `needs_operator_review`: explicitly awaiting human approval.

## Required fields

Every bridge manifest record must include source and destination fields:

- `source_repo`
- `source_branch_or_ref`
- `source_path`
- `source_commit`
- `source_artifact_kind`
- `destination_repo`
- `destination_branch_or_ref`
- `destination_path`
- `destination_artifact_kind`
- `bridge_direction`
- `status`
- `operator_review_required`
- `taste_gate_required`
- `audit_required`
- `notes`
- `next_action`

The bridge direction is one of:

- `newmath_to_automath`
- `automath_to_newmath`
- `bidirectional`

## Review and audit boundary

NewMath BEDC proposal material has a strict lifecycle:

1. AI proposes one chapter.
2. Operator review accepts or rejects.
3. Acceptance may create a paper seed-stub with `\origin{ai}`.
4. Audit blocks any AI-origin chapter from leaving seed closure unless the
   closure status cites the relevant `BEDC.Derived.<X>Up.taste_gate` witness.

Automath has analogous gates around paper claim labels, Lean registry coverage,
distillation writeback review, and outreach/open-problem state. Bridge records
may refer to those systems, but this bridge layer does not write into their
runtime state.

## Local Automath evidence to reuse

Bridge consumers should prefer these existing Automath mechanisms before adding
new glue:

- `lean4/scripts/omega_ci.py audit` is the local zero-axiom and label-integrity
  gate. It scans Lean files for `sorry`, `admit`, raw `axiom`, and orphan
  paper-label doc blocks.
- `lean4/scripts/omega_ci.py inventory` and `search` are the local declaration
  retrieval path for exact Lean modules and paper labels.
- `tools/distillation/distill.py` already validates writeback packets, rejects
  visible pipeline metadata, rejects visible `/killo-golden` patch/log wording
  in paper LaTeX, and uses a configured writeback review gate.
- `tools/chatgpt-oracle/oracle_pipeline.py` already defines the staged
  publication gate model, including compile repair and audit-gate events.
- Killo/golden Lean evidence already exists under `lean4/Omega/Folding/`, for
  example Perron independence, discriminant-character obstructions, golden
  escort geometry, and normalized gauge-deficiency tail rigidity.

Future bridge records that mention Automath theorem evidence should cite exact
Lean module paths and, where available, exact `paper_*` labels.

## Supervisor pipeline

The growth-aware supervisor is the intended recurring entry point:

```bash
python3 tools/automath_newmath_bridge/bridge_supervisor.py --once
```

One pass does this:

1. Verifies the current branch from config:
   `bridge/newmath-automath-consumption`.
2. Fetches latest refs for Automath and NewMath unless `--no-fetch` is passed.
3. Merges `origin/auto-dev` into the NewMath bridge branch unless
   `--no-auto-dev-sync` is passed.
4. Discovers new or changed artifacts from both repos.
5. Synthesizes readiness from both repo contents.
6. Writes a local inbox, synthesis report, and transfer plan.
7. Runs deterministic gates.
8. Dry-runs the Automath-to-NewMath BEDC BOARD adapter, or applies it with
   `--apply-bedc-board-ingest`.
9. Merges the gated bridge branch back to `bedc-claim-packet-pipeline` unless
   `--no-merge-back-after-gates` is passed.
10. Optionally writes local review packets if `--apply-writeback-packets` is
   passed.

Continuous mode:

```bash
python3 tools/automath_newmath_bridge/bridge_supervisor.py \
  --poll-interval 300
```

Stop continuous mode by creating:

```text
tools/automath_newmath_bridge/.bridge_supervisor.stop
```

The supervisor follows the local distillation/oracle pattern:

- fixed branch guard;
- stop file;
- fetch before each pass;
- merge `origin/auto-dev` into the bridge branch before scanning;
- dry local runtime artifacts;
- deterministic gates before local packet writes;
- Automath-to-NewMath candidates enter BEDC only through `board_spawn`;
- local merge-back into the BEDC branch only after all bridge gates pass;
- no push;
- no external send;
- no direct durable paper / Lean / docs writes.

Local runtime outputs:

- `tools/automath_newmath_bridge/inbox/bridge_inbox.jsonl`
- `tools/automath_newmath_bridge/inbox/writeback_packets/*.json`
- `tools/automath_newmath_bridge/out/bridge_transfer_plan.md`
- `tools/automath_newmath_bridge/out/bridge_synthesis_report.md`
- `tools/automath_newmath_bridge/out/bridge_synthesis.jsonl`
- `tools/automath_newmath_bridge/out/bridge_gate_results.jsonl`
- `tools/automath_newmath_bridge/state/bridge_state.json`
- `tools/automath_newmath_bridge/logs/bridge_supervisor.log`

Those files are intentionally ignored. Durable project decisions belong in
`bridge_manifest.jsonl`, not in runtime artifacts.

Durable BOARD review packets live under:

- `tools/automath_newmath_bridge/review_packets/*.json`

Those files are tracked because BEDC BOARD entries need stable `Local inputs`.
They still do not authorize paper or Lean writes.

To persist "already seen" local state:

```bash
python3 tools/automath_newmath_bridge/bridge_supervisor.py --once --update-state
```

To write local review packets for gate-passed candidates:

```bash
python3 tools/automath_newmath_bridge/bridge_supervisor.py \
  --once \
  --update-state \
  --apply-writeback-packets
```

These packets are review material only. They do not authorize destination
writes.

By default, a successful gated run attempts to merge the bridge branch back to
the local BEDC branch:

```bash
python3 tools/automath_newmath_bridge/bridge_supervisor.py --once
```

The configured target is `../newmath` on `bedc-claim-packet-pipeline`. The
merge-back step is intentionally conservative:

- it runs only after all bridge gates pass;
- it checks the target worktree is on `bedc-claim-packet-pipeline`;
- it skips if the target has tracked or untracked changes;
- it does not push unless the config explicitly sets `push: true`.

Skip merge-back explicitly:

```bash
python3 tools/automath_newmath_bridge/bridge_supervisor.py \
  --once \
  --no-merge-back-after-gates
```

To actually hand eligible Automath-to-NewMath records to BEDC `board_spawn`:

```bash
python3 tools/automath_newmath_bridge/bridge_supervisor.py \
  --once \
  --apply-bedc-board-ingest
```

This may append to `tools/bedc-deep/BOARD.md` only if BEDC's native candidate
inbox, dedup, fit/novelty, and Claude judge accept the candidate. BEDC paper
and Lean writes remain owned by the BEDC supervisor after BOARD dispatch.

## Commands

Generate a read-only candidate packet:

```bash
python3 tools/automath_newmath_bridge/scan_bridge_sources.py \
  --config tools/automath_newmath_bridge/bridge_sources.json \
  --output tools/automath_newmath_bridge/out/bridge_candidates.jsonl
```

Validate the durable manifest:

```bash
python3 tools/automath_newmath_bridge/validate_bridge_manifest.py \
  tools/automath_newmath_bridge/bridge_manifest.jsonl
```

Validate generated candidates:

```bash
python3 tools/automath_newmath_bridge/validate_bridge_manifest.py \
  tools/automath_newmath_bridge/out/bridge_candidates.jsonl
```

Render a review report:

```bash
python3 tools/automath_newmath_bridge/render_bridge_report.py \
  tools/automath_newmath_bridge/out/bridge_candidates.jsonl \
  --output tools/automath_newmath_bridge/out/bridge_report.md
```

Run deterministic gates directly:

```bash
python3 tools/automath_newmath_bridge/bridge_gates.py \
  tools/automath_newmath_bridge/inbox/bridge_inbox.jsonl \
  --output tools/automath_newmath_bridge/out/bridge_gate_results.jsonl
```

Run synthesis directly after an inbox exists:

```bash
python3 tools/automath_newmath_bridge/bridge_synthesis.py \
  --config tools/automath_newmath_bridge/bridge_pipeline_config.json \
  --input tools/automath_newmath_bridge/inbox/bridge_inbox.jsonl \
  --output tools/automath_newmath_bridge/out/bridge_synthesis.jsonl
```

NewMath constants are intentionally treated as source evidence until an
operator chooses a receiving Automath queue and audit boundary. The synthesis
layer can mark these records `blocked_automath_not_ready`; that is a useful
decision, not a failure.

## Commit message convention

Use commits that make the source-to-destination movement explicit:

```text
bridge(<direction>): <short action>

Source:
- repo: the-omega-institute/newmath
- ref: origin/auto-dev
- paths:
  - papers/bedc/scripts/prompts/phase_propose.txt
  - lean4/scripts/review_proposals.py
  - lean4/scripts/bedc_ci.py

Destination:
- repo: the-omega-institute/newmath
- ref: bridge/newmath-automath-consumption
- paths:
  - tools/automath_newmath_bridge/...
  - docs/bridge/...

Purpose:
- Establish an auditable bridge protocol before any automatic content movement.

Audit boundary:
- operator review required: yes
- TasteGate required: yes
- Lean build required: no
- external publication/send: no

AI-analysis note:
- Future agents should infer that this commit records protocol and candidate
  observation only; it does not accept, consume, publish, or synchronize content.
```

For `automath_to_newmath` commits, reverse the Source and Destination blocks.
